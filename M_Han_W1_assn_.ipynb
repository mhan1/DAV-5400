Questions I would be asking and answering by analyzing the dataset is as below:\n",

    "1. Which features of red wine is correlated to the wine quality?\n",

    "I would like to know which features of wine influence the quality of wine. I want to be able to predict the wine quality based on a feature or multiple features.\n",
    "To solve these questions, I will perform correlation analysis to see if any two numeric variables have any relationship, especially between the quality of wine(dependent variable) and one of the features(independent variables), so that I can find the independent variable(feature) that can be used as the best predictor of the wine quality(dependent variable). Also, I will conduct multiple regression analysis to identify three independent variables that offer the best prediction for the wine quality when used together in multiple regression.\n",
